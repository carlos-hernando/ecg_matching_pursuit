# ecg_matching_pursuit
Matching pursuit decomposition on electrocardiograms for joint compression and QRS detection

Description of the MATLAB code files of the different folders:
- diccios: to create the matching pursuit (MP) dictionaries of triangles and B-splines
- compresorMP: to perfrom the MP-based compressionpara realizar la compresi√≥n MP
- QRS: MP-based QRS detector. The results file from the MP-based are needed as input.
- simulaciones: other tools to gather data, create plots and generate histograms.
